Title: Sizzle 
Team Members: Jin Liu, Kevin Pham, Cifer Li, Matilda Ju
Prompt: Social-networking platform
Abstract: We want to create something that would have the basic functionalities of a social network, but yet still remain simple and elegant. We have the basics of a social platform: unique user authentication for accounts (login), posts with likes/dislikes, and the ability to comment and view other users’ posts.  
Models:
Application
Basic framework for the app, this will support all of our other features (posts, friends, comments, etc.)
User
Has name and ability to code; account is unique (authentication with username/password)
Posts (public)
Users are able to create public posts (other users on the platform can see these posts, as well as like/dislike and comment)
Friends
Users can add other users as a friend, this will be displayed on the user’s account 
Messages (private, direct between users)
Users can directly message one another (unlike the posts, these messages will be private and exclusive to the two users engaging in conversation)
Comments
Users can comment on posts made by other users

***Literally do nothing. If you're the only team that specifies this ambition feature in your project write-up, you'll get the points. (15 points)***
